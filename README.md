# gophershooter
A Go program I wrote for Gopher Night # 2

I used the library ENGi to make a simple shooting game. If I had time, I would have refactored the code and made sure not to waste memory appending infintely, but I am going to leave it as is since this was how it was when I presented at Gopher Night.
